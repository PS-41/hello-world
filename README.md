Getting started

Hi Humans!
Prakhar here. I like coding, machine learning and other software stuffs. I like working on related projects and innovative ideas. So, here I am, exploring Github as it is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets people work together on projects from anywhere.

Good luck to me!! Hope I have a beautiful journey ahead.
